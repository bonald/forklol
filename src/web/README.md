### fork.lol web frontend

More info coming....

The web frontend is written in Vue.js. To learn more about Vue.js check out https://vuejs.org/


Before you start:

1. Make sure you have nodejs installed.
2. ... probably more deps (sass maybe?) but currently really busy so I don't have the time.. :(

Getting it up and running:
1. Copy `config/dev.env.js.example` to `config/dev.env.js`
2. Run `npm run dev`

After `npm run dev` a browser window will be openen pointing to `http://localhost:8080`. At that point you can edit the code and the page will be automatically refreshed whenever you save the file.
